
Additional terms added by i-p-tel GmbH in conflict with the GPL
===============================================================

The original works (e.g. MjSIP) are licensed for public use under the
terms of the GNU General Public License (GPL).

Sipdroid is a derivative of MjSIP, and Lumicall is a derivative of Sipdroid.
Therefore, each project inherits the GNU GPL of the work it is based on.

Section 7 of the GPL allows the author of a piece of work to create
`additional permissions' in their license.  i-p-tel have
mis-interpreted this and asserted that section 7 allows them to create
additional restrictions on the use of the code.  Such restrictions are
clearly not `permissions' as they limit the freedom of developers extending
this work, so it would therefore no longer be compatible with the
GPL of MjSIP and therefore the restrictions are not entirely valid.

The first restriction contains two parts:

1.a) Displaying copyright/license text in the About box and
     ensuring the box is easily accessible.
     
     Comment:
     - in principal, this is compatible with 7(b) of the GPL,
       and the GPL already specifies in general terms that
       copyright/license text must be available in an appropriate
       manner.
     - for an Android application, an About box seems like a
       reasonable way to represent the copyright/license text
     
1.b) Not displaying any activity other than the Sipdroid main
     Activity when the user enters the application.  In
     particular, a prohibition on the creation of any
     startup activity to facilitate rapid/convenient
     registration with a SIP provider.
     
     Comment:
     - this term appears to be intended to ensure that the
       user is not prevented from accessing the
       copyright/license text
     - nonetheless, it restricts usage of the software in a
       way that means the license is no longer `free' and
       it is not compatible with the original GPL license
       of MjSIP
     - the developer of a derivative work who adds a
       registration screen is not necessarily doing so in
       order to make the copyright/license text
       inaccessible
     - the developer of a derivative work can potentially
       provide a link from their new startup activity
       to the existing copyright/license text (this is
       what Lumicall does, to remain consistent
       with the principle of the license)
     - this particular license term is not exactly
       practical anyway: consider the case of a user who
       enters the application as a consequence of the alert
       activity that appears for incoming calls.  This
       activity has bypassed the main activity.  To remain
       truly consistent with the license, the user would
       have to have access to the license text every
       time their phone receives a SIP call.
       
2)   Modified versions may not use the package name
     `org.sipdroid.sipua'
     
     Comment:
     - This appears to refer to the package name
       in the context of Android, rather than the
       Java package name.
     - for practical reasons, an end user would
       have trouble installing two applications on
       their phone if both have the same Android
       package name.  Therefore, anyone making a
       derivative work should consider the use
       of an appropriate package name.
     - as the package name contains the name of the
       project (sipdroid), this term may be
       compatible with s7(c) of the GPL,
       requiring the producer of a derivative work
       to ensure their work is marked in such a way
       to distinguish it from the original work
     - therefore, users of Lumicall are strongly
       encouraged to use a distinct package name
       for any derivative work they publish to the
       Android Market or Google Play

Additional Terms according to GPL, Section 7
============================================

When using the code of Sipdroid Open Source Project you must comply with the following terms:

1) The main activity (Sipdroid.java) allows to acess a menu. From this menu you can choose the About Box displaying legal notices and author attributions.
This functionality must be left fully intact. There must be no other activity put in front of the main activity on startup. You may not direct the user into another screen (e.g. Preferences), either on first or subsequent startups.
The message of the About box must be left unchanged, too. However, you may add further infos (e.g. Features of your modified version) to the end of the text.

2) Modified version may not keep the package name "org.sipdroid.sipua". It must be modified, too.

Expressing these additional terms does not imply that you would otherwise - if they were missing - be allowed to remove the legal notices and author attributions. It is just written down to make totally clear and to avoid any further discussion when a violation occurs.
